# roast


DEFINITIONS FOR CLARITY:
'bean'   = the characteristics of the green beans, ex: Sidamo
'sample' = the data read by a sensor in [[time, value],...] pairs, ex: [[10.0, 99.5],...] 
'batch'  = specific to the particular run, ex: batch #21, 80g
		 NOTE: sampled data is stored in the batch dictionary
'roast'  = the big picture, the process, or possibly interchangeable with 'batch'
'profile'= the desired temperature over the course of the roast... a profile is no different in format from a batch
		 in fact, a batch could be used as a profile
